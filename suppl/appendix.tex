\chapter{Procuring the Hardware}\label{shield-appendix}
One may need some or all of the components listed below to carry out
the experiments explained in the book:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Arduino Uno
\item Components required to build the shield
\item External actuators that work with the shield
\item Components required for the breadboard based experiments 
\end{enumerate}
We now provide an approximate cost of the above parts, mainly to keep
a beginner informed, see \tabref{tab:cost}.  Because of the
fluctuations in exchange rates, and the availability issues, pricing
could change considerably.

\begin{table}

  \caption{Approximate cost of the components}
  \label{tab:cost}
  \begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|c|}\hline
    Item & Cost (\rupee) \\ \hline
    Arduino Uno & 450 \\ \hline
    Components for the shield, given in \tabref{tab:shield-values} &
    300 \\ \hline
    External actuators (motor, motor driver, servo motor) to work with
    the shield & 400 \\ \hline
    Half breadboard & 250 \\ \hline
    Components that go with the breadboard & 700 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

With the components and the Gerber file mentioned in
\secref{shield-hw}, it should be possible to create the PCB, and
solder the components, so as to arrive at the shield, as
shown in \figref{shield}.  This is the least expensive option.

A lot more expensive option is to request the FOSSEE Team to create a
shield and to supply it.  It is a lot more expensive, because the cost
of the manpower who will make the shield is also to be factored.  As
this work is not a part of IIT Bombay's regular activity, it has to be
carried out through personnel specifically employed for this purpose.
The FOSSEE team has a limited supply of shields, available at
\rupee1,000 each.  Interested people may contact
\href{mailto:FLOSS-arduino@fossee.in}{FLOSS-arduino@fossee.in} or at
+91 22 2576 4133.  As mentioned above, the cheapest way is to make the
shield by oneself, by procuring the components and making the PCB.

If you write to us at the above email address, we may be in a position
to give details of vendors who can supply the above components, and
also the shield.  The advantage may be that these vendors may be able
to supply these components and the shield at a price lower than that
of FOSSEE.  In case the readers know about some vendors who can meet
this demand, please let us know and we will be happy to include them
in our list.
